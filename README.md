A simple implementation of HealthKit &amp; ARKit

The app has below features:
1. The app shows the steps taken by the user on that day.
2. The user can set a target for a number of steps.
3. The app uses color code to highlight the efforts user needs to make to reach the goal:
     - If the user has reached up to 30% of the goal then the number of steps taken are shown in red color.
     - If the user has taken the steps more than 30% of the goal but hasn't yet reached the goal then the number of steps taken are shown in orange color.  
     - When the user reaches the goal, the number of steps taken are shown in green color.
4. The success of reaching the goal is celebrated by showing UsDZ model as a QLPreviewItem.
